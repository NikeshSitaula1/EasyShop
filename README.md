## Phases Overview

### Phase 1 - CategoriesController
- Implemented RESTful endpoints for managing product categories:
    - `GET /categories`: Fetch all categories.
    - `GET /categories/{id}`: Fetch a category by ID.
    - `POST /categories`: Add a new category (admin-only).
    - `PUT /categories/{id}`: Update a category (admin-only).
    - `DELETE /categories/{id}`: Delete a category (admin-only).

### Phase 2 - Bug Fixes
- **Bug 1:** Fixed incorrect product search results by optimizing SQL queries and handling query parameters correctly.

- **Bug 2:** Resolved duplication issues during product updates by ensuring existing products are updated instead of creating new entries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- MySQL Database Server
- Postman or another API testing tool
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository into your working directory:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
2. Set up the MySQL database:
    - Import `create_database.sql` from capstone-starter folder into MySQL Workbench and execute it to create the `easyshop` database.
    - The database includes three users:
        - **Admin:** Username: `admin`, Password: `password`
        - **Users:** Username: `user`, Password: `password` | Username: `george`, Password: `password`
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
4. Copy all files from capstone-starter folder and paste it in your repository. Run the files from an IDE. That will be your Backend
5. Run the files from capstone-client-web-application folder from an IDE. That will be your frontend.
6. Use Postman to test API functionality or access the provided front-end.

### Authentication
- **Login:**
   ```http
   POST http://localhost:8080/login
   ```
  Request Body:
   ```json
   {
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password"
   }
- Do the same for 2 more users named, `user` and `george`.
- Send, copy the tokens they provide and paste it on the Authorization as Bearer tokens.

## Interesting Code

This method further gives an evidence of how one can combine authentication with the operations 
of the DAO. It obtains user data in an acceptable manner by using the Principal of the logged in
user and takes the profile out of the database. In java, Principal is an interface that 
provides authenticated user information.
